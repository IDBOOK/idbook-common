Verification
Generally, there are three types of authentication: enterprise institutions including companies, departments and titles; school institutions including schools and universities; citizenship including names and ID numbers.
（1）The miner data is stored in the IPFS by public-key encryption, and the miners' IPFS addresses are saved to the wallet and added to the chain.
（2）The verification party submits the miners ' public key and the authenticated content for the verification node after it is encrypted by the public key.
（3）The verification node obtains the IPFS address from the submitted data on the chain, then compares the encrypted data from the IPFS. If they are consistent, the verification will be passed.
（4）The whole process uses desensitized verification of ciphertext to ensure data security.
